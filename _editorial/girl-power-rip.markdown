Journalist and author Ella Whelan asks if feminism is still relevant or whether the fight for women's liberation has spawned a culture of victimhood that's damaging a new generation of women. Drawing upon a wealth of archive material, Ella questions the value of feminism and concludes that it is failing to empower those it claims to speak for.
