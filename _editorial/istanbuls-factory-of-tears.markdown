Writer Isobel Finkel takes us to Istanbul, where art and censorship are never too far apart. She discovers a vibrant city with a rich musical tradition that has been frequently oppressed. Now the kitsch, melancholy and forbidden sounds of the 70s are being rediscovered by a new generation of young people.
