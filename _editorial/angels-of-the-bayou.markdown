Kenny Hill was a bricklayer who arrived in the small town of Chauvin, Louisiana in 1988. Over the course of 13 years, he created a sculpture park filled with angels, self-portraits, and Americana icons that has been hailed as one of America's great works of 'outsider art'. Then, one day, he vanished without trace, never to be seen again.
