The story of the radical mural painter and activist Murad Subay who paints on the shelled and bullet-marked buildings of Yemen. Journalist Sumaya Bakhsh traces Muradâ€™s journey as he leaves Yemen for Cairo and then Britain before ultimately concluding that he must return to war-torn Yemen to continue his resistance to the forces of oppression, armed only with a can of spray paint.
