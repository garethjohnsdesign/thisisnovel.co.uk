Tim Montgomerie reflects on the largely forgotten Collect for Holy Innocents Day. Tim traces this melancholy commemoration back to one of the most harrowing stories from the Bible - Herod's massacre of all infant boys in Bethlehem. This religious holiday recalls the murder of innocent lives and remembering the violence and injustice of our world. Yet, despite its contemporary relevance, it has fallen into obscurity.
